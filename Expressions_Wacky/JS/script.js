alert("You're having a party and I need to know how many \ntables I need to bring"); //explaining to customer what is about to be asked
var numberPeople = prompt ("Please enter how many people will be attending");// asking how many guests they will have
alert("Each table sits 6"); //explaining that each table sits 6 people

var totalTables = numberPeople /6; // to find the number of tables need to take the amont of people divide by 6 which is the number of seats at each table
alert("So the total numbers of tables that I need to bring is " + totalTables);// this shows the customer how many tables i'll be bringing
